OS role
Interrupts
Disks - diff betw tracks and sectors
Process state diagram
Process creation- fork - program output
wait and waitpid
exec - will give a line and say how it works
x86 protection rings
Address spaces
System call vs library call
Monolithic kernel vs microkernel
Race conditions
Critical Region
Priority inversion vs starvation
Cooperative multitasking vs preemptive multitasking
Scheduling Algorithms - FCFS,SJN without preemption/with,Priority with/without
No memory abstraction
Address spaces
Physical address vs logical addresses
Paging Hardware
Heap fragmentation - External fragmentation
Managing free memory - Bitmap, Linked List
First Fit, Worst Fit, Best fit problem
Address translation scheme - problem
Translation Lookaside Buffer 
Effective access time
Context Switches - read abt ASIDs in that slide
Demand Paging - read what is and its advantage
Multilevel page tables
Page replacement algorithms - FIFO, optimal, LRU
Belady's anamoly
Clock page algorithm or Second chance algorithm

Why file systems
Files
File Types - Block file and Character files
Problem with directory structuree- naming and grouping problem
Two level directory
Directed Acyclic graph
Allocation methods - Contiguous allocation, Linked allocation, Indexed allocation
FAT32 is linked allocation file system
Indexed allocation disadvantage - using the inode instead of storing data
max file size - definite question
